For this level I wanted it to fit the place, an abandoned train warehouse. The idea being players stubble apon this huge building covered in thrown around storage containers and poor lighting. 
The side rooms are locker rooms, old security rooms and the overlook all covered in men who are slower more and more demonic a sort of slow realization of why the location is in such disaray.
As well as the side room having some hints at what cursed the area. The lighting is moody and somewhat dark which we can see in the changes to the secuity room here. Lots of moody dark lighting.


## Immersion and theme

The lighting for this Map was directed towards the side room and the center of the larger room. This was the draw players from the the center to the weapons and other areas of the map since it's pretty pointed for players to interact with that center room for player interactions. 
I also added a slight blue haze for everything in that center room and a more warm lighting in those drilled hallways to contrast the areas for players and give them a slight change in theme and also the general story for the area. 
The focus of players isn't upwards in the main hall because thats the heart of the "Phantom", but there's a reward for players that do with a ghostly photo of the phantom herself covering the center area.
