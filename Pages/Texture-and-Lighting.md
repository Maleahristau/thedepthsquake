# Texture & Lighting

## Immersion and theme

![alt text]( "Main Area of Map")


For this level I wanted it to fit the name, "Phantom of the Abyss" the idea being players stubble apon this huge ghost girl's tomb that seems to be nowhere. 
The side rooms are the vents of energy the girl is giving off and of course the main room is her in herself. For the player, that means the main room has a more blue undertone the ghostly hue on everything, whereas the side rooms are warm and red.
As well as the second floor in all of the side rooms have different roof textures to softly tell the story of the Phantom!

## Guidance and orientation

The lighting for this Map was directed towards the side room and the center of the larger room. This was the draw players from the the center to the weapons and other areas of the map since it's pretty pointed for players to interact with that center room for player interactions. 
I also added a slight blue haze for everything in that center room and a more warm lighting in those drilled hallways to contrast the areas for players and give them a slight change in theme and also the general story for the area. 
The focus of players isn't upwards in the main hall because thats the heart of the "Phantom", but there's a reward for players that do with a ghostly photo of the phantom herself covering the center area.
