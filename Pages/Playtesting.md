# Play Testing!

Throughout the process of building I have used a microsoft form to collect responses from playtesters.
Here's a link to that form:

## Version 0.2 - Boss Room Changes

One of the first things that was said to be confusing to players was the boss room to get the last key. 
The layout had players able to see the boss way before they could get to the area and then he would follow them throughout the main
hall which made the dificulity way too high so to combat that, I flipped the whole level and forced the boss to not see/ hear the 
players too early while players could get a glimpse of it still.

The next large point that was mentioned was the First room being a bit confusing because it was so open, players were just getting
bombarded with the enenimes inside. While not too many if one on one all together way too much. So to change the flow a bit I added
another wall of lockers to block the direct way to the key room which forces players to incounter each enemy in pairs instead of all at once.
