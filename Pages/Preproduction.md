## Real World/Game Examples:

I’m really drawn to the dark, atmospheric vibes that some of these games evoke. Think along the lines of Dark Academia there’s something haunting yet poetic about the environments, where every detail hints at hidden stories waiting to be uncovered. 
The sense of foreboding, the subtle unease of knowledge being just out of reach, all wrapped in a melancholic charm. Garden horror is a unique fusion of nature and the macabre.
Imagine overgrown gardens where once-beautiful, sprawling estates now hold decaying beauty. Twisting vines climb cracked statues, and flowers bloom with eerie, unnatural colors.
This isn't a peaceful retreat but a wild, sentient, almost menacing place. It’s less about jump scares and more about the sense of melancholy, isolation, and mystery.
The dark tones and atmospheric settings invite you to explore, but with each step, the shadows seem to stretch further, and the whispers of the past grow louder.
The beauty of decay, the tension between life and death, and the hidden dangers lurking beneath the surface create a rich, immersive experience where the environment itself feels like a character in the story.

The walls curve around you, like the interior of some forgotten seed pod, carved from rough stone but veined with tangled, creeping roots that seem to pulse faintly in the dim light.For this section I wanted to have both teams maybe coming to a huge altar style area with bones and skeletons on the walls and a slightly higher up area to actually battle in. Not sure if the center should be an actual hole or just a point where the action happens but there should be a slightly raised area towards the center that players can see part of and go from one side to the other on the sides the groups are coming from. The circular design of the room draws your eye naturally to this focal point, and it feels like something is watching from below the center surface, waiting. Faintly illuminated by flickering sconces carved into the stone, the room's shadows stretch unnaturally long.
