# Blockout!

## Focus

For this Block out I wanted players to have a place to climb their way out of this tunnel area. 
Because this is a single player level the player's goal is firstly to gain power over the sections of this abandoned facility. That being unlocking room from room and space to space to eventually get out of this tunnel.
I wanted the focus for players to be on controlling more of the space.
