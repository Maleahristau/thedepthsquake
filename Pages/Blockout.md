# Blockout!

## Focus
For this Blockout I wanted players to find themselves in an abandoned facility covered in disgarded trailers and over run with junk everywhere. 
Because this is a single player level the player's goal is firstly to gain power over the sections of this abandoned facility. That being unlocking room from room and space to space to eventually
get out of this tunnel. I wanted the focus for players to be on controlling more of the space. With doors almost as checkpoints for them to relax somewhat and then keep going further to gain more space.

## First Room

For the first room I wanted players to encounter the first of the normal enenimes that are considered the easist in the game, just army men and dogs. 
They are here to lead the players to the key for the first real leg of the jounery for the player. As for lighting and general focus, I have a small window that views the room before players enter,
As well as brighter lights directing players towards the key.

After a few hallways then Security room is the next largest room. The focus is to give players another point where they need to focus up and fight for more distance.
The center piece gives players some places to move around with to avoid enemies, while also giving the eneimes some walls to hide behind as well.
For this room I wanted to give the screens in the center a nice glow as well to give more dynamic lighting for this space.

And for the last huge bastion of this level there is the boss area with the last key to leave the map! Here I wanted players to not only have the shuffler. 
While also some enemies up top shooting down to make players really have to fight to get the key upstairs. While still have ammo near the bottom giving them a choice.
