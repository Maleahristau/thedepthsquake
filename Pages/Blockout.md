# Blockout!
![alt text]("Blockout Version of Single-PLayer Quake Map")

## Focus

For this Block out I wanted players to have a place to climb their way out of this tunnel area. 
Because this is a single player level the player's goal is firstly to gain power over the map so to add to this.
I wanted the focus for players to have is verticality.
